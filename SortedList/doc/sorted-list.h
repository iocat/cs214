 * that knows how to compare the data being sorted, but your code must do the rest
 * of the bookkeeping in a generic manner.
 *
 * The comparator function will take pointers to two data items and will return -1 if the 1st 
 * is smaller, 0 if the two are equal, and 1 if the 2nd is smaller.
 *
 * The user will also supply a destruct function will take a pointer to a single data item
 *	and knows how to deallocate it. If the data item does not require deallocation, the user's
 *  destruct function will do nothing.
 *
 * Note that you are not expected to implement any comparator or destruct functions.
*  Your code will have appropriate comparator function and a destruct functions added to it.
